# TF-IDF-Logistic-regression

the data provides a file with 4143 ads, each ad in a row labeled as either -1 (not relevant) or 1 (relevant). The objective is to develop
a predictive model that can classify ads automatically. First created a TF-IDF matrix to eximine the dataset then used logistic regression to split the data and develop a model to classify the documents as ‘relevant’ or ‘non-relevant.’
